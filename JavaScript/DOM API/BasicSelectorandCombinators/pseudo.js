// Pseudo-classes
// The : pseudo matches elements based on their states:
// element:state
// For example, the li:nth-child(2) selects the second <li> element in a list:

let listItem = document.querySelectorAll("li:nth-child(2)");

// Pseudo-elements
// The :: represent entities that are not included in the document therefore the querySelector() method cannot select pseudo-elements.

// The querySelector() finds the first element that matches a CSS selector or a group of CSS selectors.
// The querySelectorAll() finds all elements that match a CSS selector or a group of CSS selectors.
// A CSS selector defines elements to which a CSS rule applies.
